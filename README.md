# 303_summer_23

In this program, I searched 10 topics and get errors with 3 of them when using wikipedia.page() function
I checked the first topic "generative artificial intelligence"
When I use "generative artificial intelligence - Wikipedia" as the parameter to the wikipedia.page(), that works
In order to solve this bug, I used try, expect, and continue to raise expection of the error ones and jump them to the next iteration
However, the page could be found when I changed the auto_suggest as False in the wikipedia.page().
